# LeetCode
My solutions for LeetCode problems (mostly in JavaScript)

# Notes
* The solutions proposed are not necessarily the fastest/best ones, so beware when taking them as a reference
* The code has no comments **intentionally**, so that every time I go through a problem for a second time I rethink about it again (a bit)
* There are three useful commands into the `Makefile`
  * `info`: counts the number of solved problems
  * `check`: check the syntax and code conventions of the JavaScript solutions
  * `fix`: fix the style (indentation, spaces, etc.) of the JavaScript solutions
